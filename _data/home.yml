      Just 30 minutes from Cartagena’s downtown lies one of the most important and interesting ecological attractions of the Caribbean region. The Botanical Garden of Cartagena “Guillermo Piñeres” houses a collection of more than 300 plant species of the Colombian tropical dry forest and additional weird and wonderful ornamental plants from other tropical regions of the world. It also includes one of the last remaining virgin native forests in the region and is thus an important resource for the restoration of the tropical dry forest.We count with 2 km of trails that cross the special collections of the Botanical Garden: the Orchidarium, Palmetum, Jacquin Garden, Arboretum, Serophytic Garden, Evolutionary Garden, among others. Furthermore, unique in the region, a natural spring provides a source of clean fresh water that runs throughout the year. This refreshing spring cascades through the forest and garden, feeding numerous plants, fungi and animals. Come and enjoy our splendid flowers, birds, monkeys and butterflies, and be amazed by giant ancient trees and strangling lianas. Besides, during the rainy season of the year, an amazing diversity of mushrooms with incredible shapes and colors emerge from the forest. This Botanical Garden is an ideal place to meet and experience the fauna, flora and funga of the Colombian Caribbean!
